# Step1. Prepare a Web Server

Lunch two(2) Redhat EC2 instances, name them Webserver and Database Server
1.	Launch an EC2 instance that will serve as "Web Server". Create 3 volumes in the same AZ as your Web Server EC2, each of 10 GiB.

2.	Attach all three volumes one by one to your Web Server EC2 instance

3.	Open up the Linux terminal to begin configuration.
4.	Use **lsblk** command to inspect what block devices are attached to the server. Notice names of your newly created devices. All devices in Linux reside in /dev/ directory. Inspect it with **ls /dev/** and make sure you see all  newly created block devices there â€“ their names will likely be **xvdf, xvdh, xvdg.

5.	Use df -h command to see all mounts and free space on your server

Shows no mount is done yet. NOTE: **/dev** means device
U can run 
```
sudo ls /dev
```

5.	Use **gdisk** utility to create a single partition on each of the 3 disks
```
 sudo gdisk /dev/xvdf
 sudo gdisk /dev/xvdg
 sudo gdisk /dev/xvdh
 ```
![Picture1 4](https://github.com/Seyifunmi0604/DevOps_Project/assets/130314772/f99b4b73-a1a6-4eca-9ea2-b51f653cd389)

6.	Use **lsblk** utility to view the newly configured partition on each of the 3 disks.

7.	Install [lvm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)) package using 
```
sudo yum install lvm2 -y
```
Run which **lvm** to confirm lvm is installed and where it is installed.

Run **sudo lvmdiskscan** command to check for available partitions.
```
sudo lvmdiskscan
```

Note: Previously, in Ubuntu we used **apt** command to install packages, in RedHat/CentOS a different package manager is used, so we shall use yum command instead.

8.	Use **pvcreate** utility to mark each of 3 disks as physical volumes (PVs) to be used by LVM
```
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdg1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdh1
```
**or run it at once**
```
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdh1
```

9.	Use **vgcreate** utility to add all 3 PVs to a volume group (VG). Name the VG **webdata-vg**
```
sudo vgcreate webdata-vg /dev/xvdh1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdf1
```
![Picture1 9](https://github.com/Seyifunmi0604/DevOps_Project/assets/130314772/dec60e82-46f5-47ec-9ad4-8b4271ee54cf)

10.	Verify that your VG has been created successfully by running 
```
sudo vgs
```

11.	Use **lvcreate** utility to create 2 logical volumes. **apps-lv (Use half of the PV size), and logs-lv Use the remaining space of the PV size**. **NOTE:** apps-lv will be used to store data for the Website while, logs-lv will be used to store data for logs.
```
sudo lvcreate -n apps-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
sudo lvcreate -n logs-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
```
12.	Verify that your Logical Volume has been created successfully by running 
```
sudo lvs
```

13.	Verify the entire setup.
```
sudo vgdisplay -v #view complete setup - VG, PV, and LV
sudo lsblk 
```

14.	Use mkfs.ext4 to format the logical volumes with ext4 filesystem
```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv
```
15.	Create **/var/www/html** directory to store website files
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html
```
16.	Create **/home/recovery/logs** to store backup of log data
```
sudo mkdir -p /home/recovery/logs
```
17.	Mount **/var/www/html** on **apps-lv** logical volume
Note before mounting: to check if there are existing files run;
```
ls -l /var/www/html 
```
![Picture1 1](https://github.com/Seyifunmi0604/DevOps_Project/assets/130314772/dfd401af-a783-488e-8f21-7a98ad4eb178)

```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv /var/www/html/
```
18.	Use **rsync** utility to backup all the files in the log directory **/var/log** into **/home/recovery/logs** (This is required before mounting the file system)
```
ls -l /var/log 
```
![Picture1 2](https://github.com/Seyifunmi0604/DevOps_Project/assets/130314772/0c6ce0ae-3db6-41b6-a892-f2cd111c77cd)
```
sudo rsync -av /var/log/. /home/recovery/logs/
```

19.	Mount **/var/log** on **logs-lv** logical volume. (Note that all the existing data on /var/log will be deleted. That is why step 15 above is very
important)
```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv /var/log
```
20.	Restore log files back into /var/log directory
```
sudo rsync -av /home/recovery/logs/. /var/log
```
double check 
```
sudo ls -l /var/log
```

```
df -h
```
![Picture1 4](https://github.com/Seyifunmi0604/DevOps_Project/assets/130314772/849e3e58-1298-4336-bdbf-4822cd44447a)

21.	Update /etc/fstab file so that the mount configuration will persist after restart of the server.

The UUID of the device will be used to update the **/etc/fstab** file;
```
sudo blkid
```

## Modify the highlighted as below:
```UUID=a35f4065-df34-458a-9356-18cf0078ece7 /var/www/html ext4 defaults 0 0```
```UUID=e9ad8c34-6965-44d0-ab12-f3c54142de80 /var/log      ext4 defaults 0 0```

1.	Test the configuration and reload the daemon
```
sudo mount -a
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
2.	Verify your setup by running **df -h**, output must look like this:
